# CVRData

This project is meant to be an open source, high-level library to help access the Danish Central Virksomhedsregister (Central Business Registry).

The first library we're building will help access the data stored in Elasticsearch.

Later on we'll be looking at build libraries to access the other types of API available.

To be able to access the data, you'll need to register for an username and password. This page has the details: https://datacvr.virk.dk/artikel/system-til-system-adgang-til-cvr-data
